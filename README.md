#### 1. Predictive Modelling and Performance Analysis:
Various predictive modelling techniques are used to analyze Zomato restaurants data and also use various performance metrics
and methodologies are used to analyze various ML models and avoid over or underfitting. Scikit is used to perform the Analysis.
#### 2. Text Classification:
Collocation extraction is performed on Newsgroups to Tokenize this corpus and performed part-of-speech tagging on it. 
Applied the techniques like Frequency with filter, PMI, T-test with filter, Chi-Sq test to extract bigram collocations from the corpus. Train SVM and Multinomial NB and analyze result using a confusion matrix.
#### 3. Spatial and Temporal Analysis:
Performed Spatial and Temporal Analysis on vessels that visited ports in the provided shapefile (Nima_Ports.Zip) and Shown the density (i.e., density is the number of AIS messages in a port), of each port on a map by
using a colour-coded map. Clustered the ports based on their message density using DBSCAN and categorize the ports based on
traffic (message density).
